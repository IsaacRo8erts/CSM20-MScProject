# CSM20-MScProject

For my masters project I designed and implemented a system to detect the engagement level of a student. 226 videos were used to train my system, the videos featured different students with differing facial features and complexions, this helped ensure an accurate and fair detection system. Different variables were used to decide on an outcome of engagement level. These variables included the following: gaze detection, blink detection, emotion detection, speech detection, and lastly, pose detection. The results were exported into a CSV to create a dataset. Using different ML techniques we discovered that my system was able to perform with an accuracy of 90%.
