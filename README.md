# CSM20-MScProject

For my masters project I designed and implemented a system to detect the engagement level of a student. To train my system we fed videos with students showing a range of engagement levels and exported the results into a CSV. Over 100 videos were used to train my system that featured students with different facial features and complexions, this helped ensure an accurate and fair detection system. Different variables were used to decide on an outcome of engagement level. These variable included the following: gaze detection, blink detection, emotion detection, speech detection, and lastly, pose detection. Using different ML techniques we discovered that my system was able to perform with an accuracy of 90%.
